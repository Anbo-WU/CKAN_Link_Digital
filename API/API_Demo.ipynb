This allows us to perform various operations on a CKAN instance, such as retrieving datasets, creating resources, and managing metadata, showcasing the flexibility and ease of working with CKAN’s extensive API.\n","\n","## API versions\n","The CKAN APIs are versioned. If you make a request to an API URL without a version number, CKAN will choose the latest version of the API:\n","\n","http://www.ckandemo.site:8888/api/action/package_list\n","\n","Alternatively, you can specify the desired API version number in the URL that you request:\n","http://www.ckandemo.site:8888/api/3/action/package_list\n","\n","## Comments\n","1. The CKAN API provides a wide range of functions that cover almost all aspects of data management:\n","Data publication and updates,\n","Metadata management,\n","User and organization management,\n","Search and discovery,\n","Resource management.\n","2. While CKAN itself is written in Python, the API can be accessed using any programming language that can make HTTP requests. This flexibility allows developers to integrate CKAN with a wide variety of systems and applications.\n","3. Suggestion: Consistent Response Handling.\n","The CKAN API currently uses different HTTP status codes to indicate various states of the API response. While this approach is common in many APIs, it can lead to inconsistencies and complexities in error handling for client applications.\n","Suggest remove other responses, and instead send a 200 OK response and use the 'success' and 'error' items.\n","4. The CKAN API’s update method is overly aggressive in its behavior. When performing an update, any parameters not explicitly provided in the dictionary are deleted, including important components like resources. This leads to unintended data loss, as resources associated with datasets can be completely removed if they aren't passed in the update request.\n","Suggestion: Resources should be preserved during updates, as CKAN already provides dedicated APIs (resource_create, resource_update, and resource_delete) for managing resources. This would ensure that only explicitly modified fields are updated, while preserving the existing dataset structure, especially resources, which are often managed separately from other metadata.\n","4. The CKAN API documentation includes some descriptions of required permissions for each API, but these descriptions lack sufficient detail and specificity. Users would benefit from having a dedicated section in each API's description explicitly outlining the required permissions. This should indicate whether the API requires authentication and, if so, specify the permission level required (e.g., admin, editor, member, or anonymous).\n","\n","## Reference\n","1. https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.11/api/index.html\n","2. https://github.com/ckan/ckanapi?tab=readme-ov-file\n"],"metadata":{"id":"CaqZKRuwr296"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"5l74C_0hvujg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Set up the enironment\n","This code snippet sets up the environment by installing the ckan package and importing necessary modules for interacting with a CKAN instance.\n","\n","ckan -c /etc/ckan/default/ckan.ini user token add doi_admin ForAPI"],"metadata":{"id":"qeUS-DqgxGg9"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Install the ckanapi library\n","!pip install ckanapi\n","\n","from ckanapi import RemoteCKAN, CKANAPIError\n","\n","import requests\n","import json\n","\n","# Our CKAN instance URL.\n","ckan_url = \"http://www.ckandemo.site:8888\"\n","\n","ua = \"CKAN API Demonstration Using Python /1.0 (+http://ckandemo.site:8888)\"\n","\n","ckan_no_token = RemoteCKAN(ckan_url, user_agent=ua)\n","\n","# user doi_admin\n","token_doi_admin = \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJiT01WTEYwZW5QaU95aGM4U3RDYUtYSXBiTW1QU3VXemlNbGE0bUh4ZHlVIiwiaWF0IjoxNzI2NzM3NjM3fQ.a0J3470t9szPZMMDSSc31etuZBJUkVN1wQ3VWj53b8Q\"\n","ckan_doi_admin = RemoteCKAN(ckan_url, apikey=token_doi_admin, user_agent=ua)\n","\n","\n","# For formate code\n","# !pip install black[jupyter]\n","# from google.colab import drive\n","# drive.mount(\"/content/drive\")\n","# Anytime you want format your code run:\n","# !black /content/drive/MyDrive/Accelerating/API_Demo.ipynb\n","# Don't save your notebook, hit F5 to refresh the page"],"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"id":"ijB9IIgwsT8a"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## ckan.logic.action.get\n","API functions for searching for and getting data from CKAN."],"metadata":{"id":"irdWvex8aLrh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### ckan.logic.action.get.organization_list_for_user\n","ckan.logic.action.get.organization_list_for_user(context: Context, data_dict: dict[str, Any])→ List[dict[str, Any]]\n","\n","Return the organizations that the user has a given permission for.\n","\n","By default this returns the list of organizations that the currently authorized user is member of, in any capacity."],"metadata":{"id":"Ux4royTo5yRE"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def get_organization_list_for_user_with_ckanapi():\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Use ckanapi to get organization_list_for_user.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","      A list of organizations or None if an error occurred.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    try:\n","        organization_list = ckan_doi_admin.action.organization_list_for_user()\n","        return organization_list\n","\n","    except CKANAPIError as e:\n","        print(f\"CKAN API error: {e}\")\n","    except Exception as e:\n","        print(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\")\n","    return None\n","\n","\n","def get_organization_list_for_user_with_requests():\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Use requests to get organization_list_for_user.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","      The JSON response data or None if an error occurred.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    url = ckan_url + \"/api/3/action/organization_list_for_user\"\n","\n","    try:\n","        headers = {\"Authorization\": token_doi_admin}\n","        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n","        if response.status_code == 200:\n","            data = response.json()\n","            return data\n","        else:\n","            print(f\"Error: Status code {response.status_code} {json.dumps(response.json(), indent=4)}\")\n","    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n","        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n","    return None\n","\n","\n","print(\"get_organization_list_for_user_with_ckanapi result: \")\n","result_ckanapi = get_organization_list_for_user_with_ckanapi()\n","if result_ckanapi:\n","    for organization in result_ckanapi:\n","        print(json.dumps(organization, indent=4))\n","\n","print(\"\\n\\nget_organization_list_for_user_with_requests result: \")\n","result_requests = get_organization_list_for_user_with_requests()\n","if result_requests:\n","    print(json.dumps(result_requests, indent=4))"],"metadata":{"id":"12nAbQPP4ElC"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### ckan.logic.action.get.package_list\n","ckan.logic.action.get.package_list(context: Context, data_dict: dict[str, Any])→ List[str]\n","\n","Return a list of the names of the site’s datasets (packages).\n","\n","On early CKAN versions, datasets were called “packages” and this name has stuck in some places, specially internally and on API calls.
