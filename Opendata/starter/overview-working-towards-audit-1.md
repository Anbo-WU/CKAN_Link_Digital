# Working towards Audit 1

In order to get you started, this *Getting Started* project has been populated with most of the governance items required to reach your first [milestone](./concept-milestones.md).

That being said, there is much work for you to do. However, with the guidelines provided in this project, you should be able to complete all of the tasks required to reach *'Milestone 1'* and thus satisfy the expectations of *TechLauncher Audit 1*.

## Tailor the *Starter Project* your project specific needs

Once you have made a copy of this project, you will need to update various elements to reflect your own project.

### Add project members

* Add your team members, shadows, tutors and client (if possible) to your project 

* Modify the example [*Assignee labels*](./setup-labels.md) with the names of your team members.

### Create your Landing Page

Your GitLab project *'README.md'* file, which is displayed on the home page of your project, will be your project *Landing Page*. 

By default, the *'README.md'* provides an introduction to this *'Getting Started'* project. 

You will need to replace the current contents with your own *Landing Page* in accordance with the requirements for *Landing Pages* documented on [this page of the TechLauncher website](https://comp.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/current_students/evaluation/project_audits/#audit-landing-page).

### Add process descriptions

While this project has been populated with labels, boards, and milestones to get you started, most of them have empty descriptions.

[GitLab Flavored Markdown (GLFM)](./concept-glfm.md) is used to write text in GitLab. To get started with GLFM, you could start by completing the description of each team member's [*Assignee label*](./setup-labels.md). You can then provide descriptions for the first *Milestone*.

You should then consider fully describing each of the labels involved in the various *issue boards* we have defined including the [Task Managment](./setup-task-management-board.md) board, [Decision Log](./setup-decisions-board.md) and [Feedback Log](./setup-feedback-board.md). This will describe and familiarise team members with the various work flow processes your team will use - something that your shadows, tutors and examiners are looking for and something that will help you succeed.


## Complete tasks for your first milestone.

### Preparation

The key *Tasks* required to reach the first milestone have been added to this project and can be viewed in the *Backlog* on the [Task Management](./setup-task-management-board.md) board.

You should start by completing the *Descriptions* of these tasks. Within the context of your specific project, this will help you understand:

* the requirements and constraints on each task, 
* what might be required to complete each task,
* how each tasks might need to be modified, and
* any additional tasks that may be required 

### Managing tasks

Start managing your tasks by adding [*Assignee labels*](./setup-labels.md) to indicate who will be doing what work towards *Milestone 1*. Use the [Task Managaement](./setup-task-management-board.md) work flow to manage each task to completion.

Make sure that a record of important information is maintained in the *Task* *Activity Logs*.

### Recording team member contributions

Make sure that each team member maintains a record of the work they do in *Task* *Activity Logs*.

Each team member should also make time tracking entrys (*'Time Tracking > Add Time Entry'*) in order to record the time they spend on each task.

This information will enable effective reporting of team member contributions.
