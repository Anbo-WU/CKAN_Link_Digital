# Change Management Board

A *Change Management* board based on the following labels can be used to manage changes to agreements with clients and other key stakeholders. This will often relate to changes to the *Statement of Work*.

* **Change | Proposed**

	This list contains issues that describe proposed changes to agreements such as the *Statement of Work*. The description of change proposals should include the following:
	
	* the artefact to be changed
	* the reason for change
	* details of the proposed change
	* impact of the change on project schedule and required resources

	Details of associated negotiations should be recorded in the Change *Activity Log*.
		
* **Change | Accepted**

	Once a change has been accepted by all applicable stakeholders, it can be moved to the *Change | Accepted* state. Any discussion regarding the change should be included in the issue's *Activity Log*.

	If work is required to implement the change, then new *Tasks* will need to be identified and managed using the [*Task Management*](./setup-task-management-board.md) work flow.

	
* **Change | Rejected**

	If a change is rejected, it should be moved to the *Change | Rejected* state. An explanation of why it was rejected should be included in the change's *Activity Log*.
