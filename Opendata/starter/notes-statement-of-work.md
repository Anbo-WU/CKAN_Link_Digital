# TL Notes - Statement of Work

![stop](./images/important.png)

You are strongly encouraged to read the [TechLauncher note on *Statements of Work*](https://comp.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/files/Jan22%20-%20SOW%20Components.pdf) before continuing with the following guidelines.

## Implementing the notes in GitLab


### General
* The *Statement of Work* should be created using [GitLab Flavored Markdown (GLFM)](./concept-glfm.md) and stored in your *git* repository. Do not create an external document. 
* You should create the *Tasks* required to develop and review the *Statement of Work*. These task should be assigned to appropriate team members and managed using the *Task Management* work flow.
* Any important decisions should be recorded as *Decision* issues and managed using the [Decision Log](./setup-decisions-board.md).
* Any feedback you receive regarding the *Statement of Work* should be recorded as *Feedback* issues and managed using the [Feedback](./setup-feedback-board.md) log.

### Specific

* **Document Version**

	By storing your *Statement of Work* in the GitLab repository, you will automatically get version control and baselining features. 

	
* **Plan**

	The plan provided in the *Statement of Work* should be derived from the [milestones](./concept-milestone.md) you establish in GitLab. That is, you should first create your initial plan in GitLab as a set of milestones and associated a [Tasks](./setup-task-management-board.md). 
	
	Once you have established a plan in GitLab, you can update your *Statement of Work* with a summary of your plan including links to your GitLab plan (if all of your stakeholders have access to GitLab), or images taken from GitLab (if you need to generate a PDF for external stakeholders).
		
* **Processes**

	This is where you can describe how you will be using GitLab to manage tasks, meetings, decisions, risks and so on.
		
	To a large extent, processes are self-described by *Issue Boards*. For example, the *decision making process* can be understood by reviewing the [Decision Log](./setup-decisions-board.md) issue board and reading descriptions of the associated labels. By adding detailed descriptions to each of the *labels* involved, you can more fully describe the *decision making process*.
	
	While most processes can be described (and executed) using *Issue Boards*, there may be some that cannot. Such processes should be documented using issues labeled with [*Artefact | Process*](./setup-labels.md) and [*Task*](./setup-task-management-board.md) (to manage the work required to establish the processes)
	
	Once you have documented your processes in GitLab, you can update your *Statement of Work* with a summary of your processes including links to the applicable *issue boards* and *process* issues (if all of your stakeholders have access to GitLab), or images taken from GitLab (if you need to generate a PDF for external stakeholders).
	
* **Acceptance**

	If actual signatures are required, you will need to print a hard copy of your *Statement of Work* and get it signed. This signed document should then be scanned and uploaded to your *git* repository.
