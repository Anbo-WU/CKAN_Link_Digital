# TL Notes - Team Charter

![stop](./images/important.png)

You are strongly encouraged to read the [TechLauncher note on *Team Charters*](https://comp.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/files/Jan22%20-%20Team%20Charter%20Components.pdf) before continuing with the following guidelines.

## Implementing the notes in GitLab

### General

Refer to the notes on the [Statement of Work](./notes-statement-of-work.md).


### Specific

* **Document Version**

	By storing your *Team Charter* in the GitLab repository, you will automatically get version control and baselining features. 

* **Team Information**

	The GitLab member pages record basic information about team members including name and email. This information plus the other recommended information should be documented within the *Team Charter*.

	It is really important that you seriously and openly consider issues around team member time commitment, expected grades, skill levels, willingness to learn new things and so on. 

	Your team should have an honest and open conversation about these things so that the project can be managed effectively. For example, if a team member can only commit to 6 hours a week, then there is no point assigning more than 6 hours of work to that team member. Of course, the consequences of this must also be discussed - that is, the team member's contribution reports will reflect their reduced contribution.

	On a more positive note, if a team member's desire to learn a specific skill is known and documented in the *Team Charter*, then applicable tasks can be allocated to that team member to help them develop those skills during the project. 

	Similarly, if there are students wanting to achieve high grades, then they can be allocated tasks that will enable them to demonstrate high levels of learning.
	
	In summary, if everyone is clear on what everyone else expects from the course, then your team will avoid many of the *'team'* problems we often need to deal with in [The TechLauncher Clinic](https://comp.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/files/Jan22%20-%20Clinic.pdf).
