# Git Repositories

[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) is much more than a [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repository. It is a complete project management environment.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system that is integrated with other GitLab components to form a complete project management environment.

## What can I store in the git repository?

Contrary to common belief, *git* can be used to store both text and binary files including code, documents and images.

While *git* will track versions of any file type, it can do more with text files, including the generation of diffs and completing effective merges.
