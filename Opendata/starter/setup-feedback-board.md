# Feedback Log

A *Feedback Log* board based on the following labels can be used to maintain a record of feedback received, given and actioned.

* **Feedback | Received**

	This list contains all feedback received by the team. This includes informal feedback from stakeholders as well as formal feedback received as part of the [Many Eyes](https://comp.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/current_students/guidelines/many_eyes_process/) process.

	Each item of feedback should be described in a separate *Feedback* issue labeled with *Feedback | Received*.

* **Feedback | Actioned**

	If feedback is to be actioned, it will be moved to this state. Any discussion regarding the feedback should be included in the issue's *Activity Log*.
	
	If work is required to address the feedback, then new *Tasks* will need to be identified and managed using the [*Task Management*](./setup-task-management-board.md) work flow.
	
* **Feedback | No Action Taken**

	Some feedback may be of little value or not actionable. In this case, the feedback is moved to this state in order to clearly show that the feedback was considered by the team and that a decision was made to take no action.	
	
	If appropriate, reasons for not taking any action may be added to the issue's *Activity Log*.
	
## Feedback Origin

The following labels can be used to indicate origin of each item of feedback. 

* Feedback | From Client
* Feedback | From Tutor
* Feedback | From Shadows
* Feedback | From Examiner
* Feedback | From Clinic 

A *Feedback Origin* board might be useful to show that you have captured all feedback.

## Feedback To Shadows

In TechLauncher, you are required to provide regular feedback to your shadow team. The following labels can be used to create *Feedback Issues* that capture the feedback you provide to your shadow team. 

* Feedback | To Shadow | Being Developed
* Feedback | To Shadow | Delivered

A *Feedback To Shadows* board might be useful as a mechanism to communicate feedback to shadows and to provide evidence for tutors and examiners.
