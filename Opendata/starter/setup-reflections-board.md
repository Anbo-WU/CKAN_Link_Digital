# Reflections

A *Reflections* board based on the following labels can be used to record reflections (learning) by the team and individual students.

* **Reflection | Team**

	This list will comprise reflections made by the team as a whole.
		
* **Reflection | Individual**

	This list will comprise reflections made by individual students. These individual *Reflection* issues should be labeled with the team member's [*Assignee Label*](./setup-labels.md).
	
### Reflections and Feedback

Reflections will often relate to your processing of both informal and formal feedback. In such cases, you should discuss this in your *Reflection* *Activity Logs* and include links to the applicable *Feedback* issues recorded in your [Feedback Log](./starter/setup-feedback-board.md).
