# Guidelines for using the *Getting Started* project


These *Getting Started Guidelines* have been developed to help students learn about GitLab and how to use this *Getting Started* project to plan and manage their projects.

The *'Getting Started'* project has been setup as a skeleton that teams can copy and adapt to their own specific needs.

There are pieces of information missing, such as complete descriptions of various work flows and some tasks that need to be completed before Audit 1. 

The aim is for students to complete these descriptions and add the missing tasks. In doing so, they should learn a bit about project governance and using GitLab. They will also be off to a good start in TechLauncher.

The following pages describe how GitLab can be used to support your TechLauncher project.

* [GitLab Concepts](./overview-gitlab-concepts.md)
  * Introduces key concepts that need to be understood before using GitLab
* [Initial Setup for TechLauncher](./overview-initial-setup-for-techlauncher.md)
  * Describes how to setup GitLab to support your TechLauncher project
* [Implementing TechLauncher Notes](./overview-implementing-techlauncher-notes.md)
  * Shows how GitLab can be used to implement the guidelines outlined in the [TechLauncher Notes](https://comp.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/current_students/guidelines/)
* [Working towards Audit 1](./overview-working-towards-audit-1.md)
  * Demonstrates the use of GitLab to manage the tasks that need to be completed before Audit 1.
* [Ongoing work](./overview-ongoing-work.md)
  * Provides guidelines on how to continue using GitLab for the remainder of your project.
