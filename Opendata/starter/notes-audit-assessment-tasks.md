![stop](./images/important.png)

You are strongly encouraged to read the [TechLauncher note on *Audit assessment tasks*](https://comp.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/files/Jan22%20-%20Audit%20Assessment%20Tasks.pdf) before continuing with the following guidelines.

## Implementing the notes in GitLab

### General

All of the data you need to complete Audit tasks should be held within your GitLab project including:

* Team member commitments (Team Charter)
* All work allocated to, and completed by team members ([Task Management](./setup-task-management-board.md) work flow).

### Specific

* **Rating**

	Note the comments regarding Academic Misconduct.
	
* **Feedback**

	All feedback should be managed using the [*Feedback Log*](./setup-feedback-board.md).
	
	Make sure you create the *Tasks* required to complete any actions arising from the feedback processes. Manage these *Tasks* using the [*Task Management*](./setup-task-management-board.md) work flow.
	
* **Team Contributions**

	When rating team member contributions, make sure you take into account team member commitments as agreed in your [*Team Charter*](notes-team-charter.md). In particular, team members who have agreed to lower levels of commitment, should receive lower ratings.
	
	Note the comments regarding Academic Misconduct.

* **Rating Feedback Quality**

	Feedback quality can be rated and discussed in the *Activity Logs* of issues managed using the [*Feedback Log*](setup-feedback-board.md).
