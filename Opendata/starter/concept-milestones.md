# GitLab concept - Milestones

Milestones are used to represent the completion of key activities or stages during a project.

They provide an important way to understand project plans and progress and should be established by every project team in collaboration with clients.

Milestones need to negotiated with the client to capture key activities and events from the client's perspective.

Milestones are defined with a name, date and a set of tasks that need to be completed to achieve the milestone.

## TechLauncher Audits are NOT milestones

Note that TechLauncher *Audits* and University breaks etc. are **not** project milestones. 

Audits, for example, are just points in time at which the examiners review your progress.

University breaks and other events such as exams, are simply constraints on available time and people to work on the project. 



## Some examples

Examples of milestones include:

* **Project Approval.** This is the point at which client approval to proceed with the project is required. Tasks covering the development of a *Statement of Work* and signing applicable legal agreements will need to be planned, managed and completed to achieve such a project approval milestone.

	All TechLauncher projects should include a milestone like this one which will need to be completed in time for Audit 1.

* **Proof of Concept.** Some projects may be exploratory in nature. In such projects, it might make sense to define a point in the project at which a proof of concept must be established. If such a milestone is not achieved, the project may need to change direction. As such it could be a key event from the client's perspective.

	Tasks covering research, prototyping, demonstration and evaluation would need to be planned, managed and completed to achieve milestones such as this.

* **Minimal Viable Product (MVP).** This is a common milestone at which the client will make decisions regarding the future of a project. The client may make changes or even abandon the project if a required MVP is not produced.

	Tasks covering project management, development, testing and review would need to be planned, managed and completed to achieve milestones such as this.

* **Testing and Evaluation** Various milestones might be established to cover testing and evaluation at various points during a project.

* **Handover.** A handover milestone would capture the time at which the client wants the project to be ready for handover to the client or another development team. 

	Tasks covering the finalisation of documentation, addressing known defects, reporting remaining known defects and any proposed corrective actions would need to be planned, managed and completed to achieve a handover milestone.

	Note that, while *'handover'* will often be scheduled towards the end of a project, the client may choose an earlier date to ensure there is time to correct any problems with the handover materials.

## Your milestones will be unique to your project

Note again, that your project will likely have it's own specific milestones. We have seen all kinds of milestones covering events such as delivery of project specific functions and data, conference and exhibition deadlines, availability of funding, and availability of client supplied IP or technology.

## Milestones and Tasks

All *Tasks* must be assigned to a *Milestone*. If they are not, they will not be tracked in relation to project progress.
