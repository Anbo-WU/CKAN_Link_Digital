# Useful labels for a TechLauncher project

While most of the labels we will use are defined for use with [Issue Boards](./concept-boards.md), there are some that are more generic.

## Issue Assignee labels

The Community Edition of GitLab used by the ANU will only allow a single team member to be assigned to an issue. This is inconvenient because many of your Tasks will be worked on by more than one person.

To work around this limitation, you can define an *'Assignee'* label for each member of your team. These labels can then be added to tasks to indicate who is responsible for completing them. You can also include *preferred names* (in brackets). Some examples include:

* Assignee | Rob Younger
* Assignee | Deniz Tek
* Assignee | Phillip Hoyle (Pip)
* Assignee | Chris Masuak

What a great looking team!!
### Team member responsibility and accountability

By adding *Assignee* labels to *Tasks*, all team member responsibilities are made clear. As team members work on tasks, they will record the work they do by adding time tracking entries (*'Time Tracking > Add Time Entry'*) and  *Activity Log* posts to the applicable *Tasks*.

### 
## Artefact labels

Tasks created for managing all work will be labeled with one of the [task work flow labels](./setup-task-management-board.md). However these labels don't say anything about the nature of each task. This can be addressed be creating labels that can be used to indicate the type of artefact involved.

Examples of *Artefact* labels include:

* Artefact | Deliverable
* Artefact | Requirement
* Artefact | Document
* Artefact | Research
* Artefact | Design
* Artefact | Code
* Artefact | Test
* Artefact | Note
