# GitLab Flavored Markdown (GLFM)

[GitLab Flavored Markdown (GLFM)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html) is a text language used to write documentation. It support rich text, tables, images, section structure, and comprehensive support for cross-referencing to GitLab issues, code, boards, milestones and most other GitLab artefacts. 

*GLFM* documents are easy to write, are rendered automatically in GitLab, and can be converted to many formats including HTML and PDF.

The guidelines you are reading were all written using [GitLab Flavored Markdown (GLFM)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html).

## GitLab Text Fields

Most text fields in GitLab (eg. issue descriptions and posts to issue *activity logs*), will accept [GitLab Flavored Markdown (GLFM)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html). 

## Use GLFM to write all Documentation

You are encouraged to develop all documentation, such as your *Statement of Work*, using *GLFM*.

All such documents should be stored in your *git* repository. Tasks for developing your documents should be created and assigned to appropriate team members. The work involved can then be managed using the [Task Management](./setup-task-management-board.md) board and reported in [milestones](./concept-milestones.md).

If required, *GLFM* documents can be exported to various formats including PDF.

Of course, *git* will maintain a complete record of all changes to your *GLFM* documents - that is, who, why and when.
