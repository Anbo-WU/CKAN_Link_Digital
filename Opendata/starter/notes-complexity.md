You are strongly encouraged to read the [TechLauncher note on *Complexity-based project approaches*](https://comp.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/files/Jan22%20-%20Complexity%20based%20Project%20Approach.pdf) before continuing with the following guidelines.

You are strongly encouraged to watch the video about the [Cynefin Framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7oz366X0-8) before proceeding with these guidelines.

## Implementing the notes in GitLab

When planning your project, you should consider the information provided in this *TechLauncher Note.*

Each major task should be discussed in terms of the [Cynefin Framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7oz366X0-8). By doing this, you can make better decisions requiring the approaches you should use to complete the tasks. In particular:

* **Simple tasks** will not require elaborate processes. They will involve little, if any, decision making or risk management, and can be completed using well understood approaches.

* **Complicated tasks** will require the use of more sophisticated processes that include analysis and decision making to identify the best approaches to completing the tasks. These complicated tasks will normally be the subject of risk management processes.

*  **Complex tasks** will require the design, execution and evaluation of experiments to identify appropriate approaches to completing the tasks. Within the context of software development, such experimentation may include the development and evaluation of prototypes, trying alternative technologies, or exploring ideas with user groups. Once the results of these experiments have been evaluated, complex tasks may become *complicated*, or even *simple*, and can managed accordingly.
