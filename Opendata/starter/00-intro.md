# Introduction to the *Getting Started* project


## Project Governance

![stop](./images/important.png)

TechLauncher is about learning how to efficiently deliver projects of value to clients.

To do this, you must ensure that all project planning, execution and management activities (project governance) add value, improve quality and/or improve productivity. 

**You must never waste time on ineffective governance activities.** Always ask yourself if what you are doing makes sense and is useful. If it makes no sense or is not useful, then stop doing it!! 

Never make stuff up because you think examiners want to see it - they don't, and it may lead to an academic misconduct investigation.

To that end, we expect teams to spend no more than 10-15% of their time on project governance. New teams might spend a little more (up to 20%) because they will need to establish and *'tune'* their initial governance practices.

## The *Getting Started* project

The aim of this *'Getting Started'* project is to provide support for a streamlined set of activities that aim to minimise the time you need to spend on effective project governance. 

Specifically, it shows how GitLab can be used to **maximise** your learning, while **minimising** the effort required to effectively:

* Manage your project towards a successful outcome
* Manage stakeholder expectations
* Ensure compliance with TechLauncher expectations
* Implement guidelines provided in the [TechLauncher Notes](https://comp.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/current_students/guidelines/)
* Provide the evidence that examiners need to assess your team and individual work

## TechLauncher Clinic support

This *Getting Started* project was developed by the [TechLauncher Clinic](https://comp.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/files/Jan22%20-%20Clinic.pdf) which is an independent group of experts who are available to help TechLauncher teams address team and project related issues.

Because we have no role in assessment, you can speak with us freely. 

TechLauncher Clinic bookings can be made by emailing *Shayne Flint* (shayne.flint@anu.edu.au).
