# Implementing TechLauncher Notes

![stop](./images/important.png) 

The [TechLauncher Notes](https://comp.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/current_students/guidelines/) are an excellent and valuable source of wisdom and advice for TechLauncher teams. They were developed by a well respected and very experienced industry expert who has also worked with TechLauncher students for many years.

To date, too few teams have made use of these notes. 

So, here we show how the *Techlauncher Notes* can be implemented using the features we have built into this *Getting Started* project. Specifically, we provided guidelines for each of the following *TechLauncher Notes*.

* [Statement of Work](notes-statement-of-work.md)
* [Team Charter](notes-team-charter.md)
* [Streamlining Project Activities](notes-streamlining-project-activities.md)
* [Audit Assessment Tasks](notes-audit-assessment-tasks.md)
* [Risk Management](notes-risk-management.md)
* [Requirements](notes-requirements.md)
* [Testing Basics](notes-testing.md)
* [Estimation, Tracking and Metrics](notes-estimation.md)
* [Complexity based Project Approach](notes-complexity.md)
