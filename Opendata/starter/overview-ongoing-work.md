# Ongoing Work

It is important to note that this *Getting Started* project has been created to get your team started and, in particular, help you succeed in Audit 1.

After Audit 1, you should review the way you have been using GitLab, and make any changes you think will improve your ability to:

* Manage your project towards a successful outcome
* Manage stakeholder expectations
* Ensure compliance with TechLauncher expectations
* Implement guidelines provided in the [TechLauncher Notes](https://comp.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/current_students/guidelines/)
* Provide the evidence that examiners need to assess your team and individual work
