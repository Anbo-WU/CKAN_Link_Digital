# Initial Setup for TechLauncher

The following notes provide guidelines for setting up GitLab for a TechLauncher project.

![stop](./images/important.png)

It is very important to note that the guidelines presented and demonstrated in this *Getting Started* GitLab project are only designed to get teams started. They will need to be modified/extended as the team develops and better understands the specific needs of their team, client and other stakeholders.

As you read through these notes, you should explore the project itself in order to re-enforce the concepts being discussed. For example, when we talk about a particular *Issue Board* such as the *Task Management* board, you should open and inspect the real board.

## Project membership

### Internal project members

You should invite all of the following people to join your GitLab project. To do this, select *'Manage > Members'* from left-side menu, and then use the *'Invite Members'* button at the top-right of the *Project Members* page.

  * All Team Members
  * All Shadow Team Members
  * Tutors
  * Examiners
  * Clients (if they have ANU IDs)

### External project members

The [School of Computing GitLab installation](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/) is only accessible to people with an ANU University ID. As such, many clients will not have access to projects hosted on the school's GitLab.

This can be worked around in a number of ways as [described here](./00-intro.md).

## Labels

The following describes some general labels that should be setup for all TechLauncher projects. Additional labels relating to work flow will be defined when creating the *Project Governance Boards* described below.

* [Useful labels for a TechLauncher project](./setup-labels.md)

## Project Governance boards

Each project should consider creating the following boards and associated labels:

* [Task Management](setup-task-management-board.md)
* [Meetings](setup-meetings-board.md)
* [Decision Log](setup-decisions-board.md)
* [Risk Log](setup-risks-board.md)
* [Feedback Log](setup-feedback-board.md)
* [Change Management](setup-change-board.md)
* [Reflections](setup-reflections-board.md)
