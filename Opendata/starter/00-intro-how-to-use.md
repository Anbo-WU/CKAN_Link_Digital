# How to copy the *Getting Started* project

There are several ways to make a copy of this project and use it to support your team.

## The School of Computing GitLab instance

The [School of Computing GitLab](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/) is a self-hosted instance of the [GitLab Community Edition](https://about.gitlab.com/install/ce-or-ee/). 

You can make a copy of the *Getting Started* project within the [School of Computing GitLab](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/) as follows:

* Download the latest export of the *Getting Started* project from:
	* [Getting Started exports](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u4022606/techlauncher-starter/-/tree/main/starter/export) 
* From your GitLab home page, click **'New Project'** at the top right of the page.
* Click on the **'Import Project'** panel
* Click **'GitLab export'** (you will be importing an export of the *'Getting Started'* project)
* Enter the name of your new project in the **'Project name'** field
* Click **'Choose file'** and select the export file you downloaded in the first step above.
* Click **'Import Project'**

You should now see the landing page for your new project. It should be a complete copy of the *Getting Started* project.

The [School of Computing GitLab](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/) is only accessible to people with an ANU University ID. As such, many clients will not have access to projects hosted on the system. In this case:

* If your client does not require direct access to your GitLab project, you may be able to keep them informed by generating regular reports based on data exported from your GitLab (eg. documents, milestone status, meeting minutes etc.)

* If your client requires direct access to all of your work, then you could consider hosting your project on an external GitLab or other platform as described below.

## External GitLab instances

If your client does not have an ANU University ID, and wants direct access to your work, you could copy this *Getting Started* project and apply the guidelines provided below to a project hosted at [gitlab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) or any other externally managed GitLab instance. 

## Other Platforms

If you or your client would like to use a different platform such as [github](https://github.com/), [zenhub](https://www.zenhub.com/) or [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), then you should be able to adapt the *Getting Started* project and the following guidelines to that platform.
