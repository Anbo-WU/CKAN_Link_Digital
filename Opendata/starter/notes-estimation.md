# TL Notes - Estimation, Tracking and Metrics


![stop](./images/important.png)

You are strongly encouraged to read the [TechLauncher note on *Estimation, Tracking and Metrics*](https://comp.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/files/Jan22%20-%20Estimation,%20Tracking%20and%20Metrics.pdf) before continuing with the following guidelines.

## Implementing the notes in GitLab

### Estimation methods

As stated in this *TechLauncher Note*, there are many estimation methods (man hours, story points, etc.) that can be researched independent of these notes.

While educated guesses may be better than nothing, a relatively simple, low overhead and way more effective approach is [*Planning Poker*](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/planning-poker). 

If you would like to explore the use of estimation, then the use of *Planning Poker* is a good place to start.



## Using Planning Poker

If you would like to explore the use of *Planning Poker*, you should start by watching the following brief video to get an idea of how *Planning Poker* works.

**NOTE:** The TechLauncher Clinic can provide your team with a set of *Planning Poker* cards. We can also facilitate your first *Planning Poker* meeting - they can be a lot of fun.

### Use of GitLab

While the paid versions of GitLab support the use of story point and similar estimation techniques (like planning poker), the community edition used at the ANU does not.

However, we can effectively use *Planning Poker* estimates to manage our projects as described below.


### Making Estimates and Tracking Progress

1. Use *Planning Poker* to create estimates for the tasks in your backlog that are candidates for allocation to the next sprint.

2. Discuss and agree on a mapping of story point values (produced by *Planning Poker*) to hours. For example, you might agree that a task estimated at 2 points will take 5 hours and a 13 point task will take 20 hours.

2. Using your mapping of points to hours, calculate the estimated hours required to complete tasks in your backlog. Enter these values using the *'Time Tracking > Set Estimate'* field on each *Task*.

2. Allocate tasks for the next sprint. You will use your estimates to ensure that you allocate an appropriate number of hours work to each Team Member.

2. As work is done, team members should record the number of hours they spend on each task using *'Time Tracking > Add Time Entry'* on the applicable *Tasks*

2. At the end of each sprint, compare the actual hours worked on each task with the estimates. Based on this comparison, you may like to revise the mapping of points to hours established in step 2 in order to improve the accuracy of future estimates. 

2. Iterate back to Step 3 until the project is complete.

### Tracking progress towards Milestones

It is usually the case that, after a few sprints, revisions to your mapping of points to hours will no longer be required and estimates will, therefore, be reasonably accurate. That is, you will have calibrated your point estimates to the actual performance of your team.

It is at this point that you can start to understand how well you are tracking towards completing project milestones. You can add up the estimated hours for each task in a milestone to determine if the milestone can actually be met given the current performance of your team. If you have too much or too little work to do, you may need to negotiate changes to the *Statement of Work*.
