## Article Name: Effect of increasing the rental housing supply on house prices: Evidence 
from China’s large and medium-sized cities

## A Brief Recap:
The document analyzes the effect of increasing the rental housing supply on house prices in China’s large and medium-sized cities. It concludes that there is a weak substitution between owning and renting housing, which affects the relationship between rental housing supply and housing prices. Increasing the supply of rental housing can either increase or decrease house prices, depending on the substitutability of rental and owned housing in a given city. The study emphasizes the importance of policy decisions in shaping this relationship.
   

## 1. Dataset Used
'The data set covered 29 large and medium-sized cities3 in China between 2008 and 2019. Data on house prices, the supply of housing units, rent, and the supply of rental housing units were obtained from 
the China House Price Quotation Network, published by the China Real Estate Association (https://www.creprice.cn/). The 29 cities are either municipalities or provincial or vice-provincial capitals in China. They are the central cities of various regions and occupy important positions both politically and economically (Gao, 2008).'
- The study used a dataset comprising housing prices and rental housing supply data across various large and medium-sized cities in China.


## 2. Cleaning Process Applied
- The article does not explicitly detail the data cleaning process; however, it can be inferred that standard practices were likely applied, including handling missing values, removing outliers, and ensuring consistency in the data format.


## 3. Research Method Applied
- The research applied an econometric model(threshold regression model) to examine the relationship between rental housing supply and housing prices, focusing on the substitutability between renting and owning housing.


## 4. Results/Conclusion
- The study concluded that increasing the supply of rental housing has a variable impact on housing prices depending on the substitutability between renting and owning. In cities where substitution is weak, increasing rental supply could lead to higher house prices, while in other cases, it might lower them. Policy decisions play a crucial role in shaping these outcomes.


## 5. How would it contribute to our research?
- Apparently this article focus on the rental housing market and the relationship between it and the house prices in CHINA, not AUSTRALIA. It is not the region our project plans to work on. But the economic laws also have commonalities for different countries and regions. We can compare the data and analysis of our project with this article to see if there any obvious data distortion or outcome biases.


## 6. Thoughts about our research
- Like the article I've analyzed above, we can also explore the rental housing condition in Australia and its relationship with house prices, instead of just limit our project in rental housing market analysis. This article puts forward a new view for our research.
