## 3. Project Introduction
- **Project Goal**:  CKAN is building a diverse ecosystem under the banner of open data and government transparency. This project is not limited to developing new software or commercial tools. Its goal is to expand the ecosystem surrounding open data and explore the advancement of civic tech. Therefore, the project's ultimate purpose is to identify and address obstacles or limitations that hinder this progress. The project does not have a specific product development direction; instead, participants will explore the ecosystem, experience it as members, and discover new value.
- **Project Overview**: The client aims to expand the CKAN ecosystem and increase the number of users, including government agencies in the Canberra region, who utilize CKAN. A significant challenge is that people are not fully aware of CKAN's usability. Therefore, this project focuses on highlighting CKAN's usability by providing a strong use case. The goal is to create a data analysis report using CKAN, which will serve as a definitive use case for the CKAN community. Simultaneously, the project aims to enhance CKAN's strengths through usability analysis. This will be a year-long project, with the first semester focused on developing the use case and analyzing CKAN's strengths and weaknesses. The second semester will then focus on enhancing CKAN's functionality based on the insights gained from the first semester's analysis.
- **Scope**: The project includes software development, testing, deployment, and initial support phases, as well as report analysis and visualization, and analysis of the software’s strengths and weaknesses.
- **Project phases**: The exploration of solutions will be divided into two phases over two semesters. In the first semester, students will engage as members of the CKAN community, using CKAN to conduct a data analysis project on a chosen topic. Through this process, they will explore the various limitations of CKAN. In the second semester, based on the insights from their analysis, students will work on practical improvements, potentially developing new libraries or proposing enhancements to the CKAN system. This phase will require students to independently analyze issues and set a more detailed direction at the start of the semester.
   1) Phase 1-1: Data Analysis using CKAN
     - **Topic Selection**: Choose a relevant topic for data analysis.
     - **Data Collection**: Collect data using CKAN's data collection features.
     - **Data Cleaning**: Clean the collected data to ensure accuracy and reliability.
     - **Data Cataloging**: Catalog the cleaned data using CKAN’s cataloging tools.
     - **Data Analysis Report**: Write a comprehensive data analysis report based on the selected topic.
   2) Phase 1-2: CKAN Strengths and Limitations Analysis
     - **System Exploration**: Explore all functionalities of CKAN during the data analysis process.
     - **Strengths Identification**: Document the strengths of CKAN identified during the project.
     - **Limitations Identification**: Document the limitations and challenges encountered while using CKAN.
     - **CKAN Analysis Report**: Write a detailed report analyzing the strengths and limitations of CKAN.
   3) Phase 2: Practical Improvement Based on Analysis Reports
     - **Practical Improvements**: Enhance CKAN based on the findings from the Phase 1 analysis reports, focusing on functional improvements that address identified limitations.

- **Deliverables**:
   - **Data Analysis Report**: A report detailing the analysis performed on the selected topic using public data.
   - **CKAN Analysis Report**: A report documenting the strengths and limitations of CKAN as identified through the project.
   - **Enhanced CKAN System(Second Semester)**: Implementation of practical improvements to CKAN based on the findings from the analysis reports.
- **Desired Outcomes**: This project aims to achieve the following
   - Provide a strong user case for CKAN utilization.
   - Strengthen the open data ecosystem by developing CKAN functionalities from a user-centric perspective, enhancing the overall user experience and utility of CKAN.
- **Key Stakeholders**:
    - **Project Client**: Link Digital(Steven De Costa)
    - **Project Manager**: Doeun Han / Songxuan Li
    - **Technical Manager**: Yuxin Mu
    - **Development Team**: Diao Fu, Anbo Wu, Qifeng Zheng, Chuang Ma
    - **End Users**: Policy maker, the general public, CKAN community members, etc.
