## Meeting Objectives
Communicate with the client to clarify their needs. Get famailar with their product. 
## Agenda
1. The client introduce their product and their projects before (30min)
2. Self-introduction of team members to identify strengths and roles with CKAN implementation (15min)
3. Discuss what kind of project may be avaliable and applicable (45min)
4. Introduce online datasheet of ckan and tutorials on youtube (15min)
5. Discuss the solutions for long-term planning (15min)
## Meeting Minutes
1. About the client's product:
   1. It is a open-source data management system called CKAN, which is supported by a datalink company to provide service for the government and researchers.
   2. There are currently 26 data attributes in datasets, ensuring they are machine-readable and understandable.
   3. It is mainly used to support policy making by the government. It is believed to make contributions to building civic behavior and an attuned political system.
   4. It is licensed under AGPL3, allowing for open use and modification.
   5. There were some big projects before based on it: improving climate change policies in Canada, NSW government portal for publishing data assets, etc.
2. Points highlighted by the client:
   1. Align with legislations: the importance of conceptual-level rules for code writing instead of language-level rules.
   2. Emphasis on compliance: using data as evidence to make policies so that this data management system can help.
   3. The significance of public data: similar contributions to the use of open-source technologies and an easy access for people is important
   4. Some aspects need to be considered in the future data management: social contracts, power dynamics, and cultural considerations, etc.
   5. Also, policies may be adaptive, so we need to change the way to approach with the time. 
3. Ideas of what to do for this sememster given by team members:
   1. add AI tools to the CKAN to analysis data automatically and give a initial thoughts
   2. collect some open data and use CKAN to do a data analysis project
4. Previous and potential examples given by the client:
   1. use the 550 data portals to analysis which country has the highest speed of publishing QR codes during COVID-19
      (a potential condition that different governments cannot share data but the result of data analysis may be beneficial)
   2. explore the idea of using digital twins to predict outcomes based on data
   3. an application called Table Designer combining AI with it
5. Functions on datasheet:
   1. for portal managers: there are some plots for datasetss and resources
   2. for developers: plugins and portals are shown and developers can know how many portals use plugins
   3. for researchers: there are statistical data and researchers can know which kinds of tags used in the portal
   4. also, different portals can be used to map the relationship
6. Agreement on potential solutions: the client did not give a final decision for specific requirements on the meeting but promise give us a document including some detailed requirements asap and we may start from learning deeper on CKAN
