## Key take-aways:

2. Engagement with CKAN Community:
The client recommended engaging with the CKAN community, particularly on Gitter, for quicker resolution of technical issues, instead of spending too much time troubleshooting independently.

While data collection is ongoing, the client advised the team to focus on alternative strategies if challenges persist, especially considering the value pillars (data analysis, collaboration, and learning).

4. Reflection Report:
The team will prepare a weekly reflection report that captures their learning and journey through the project, including any installation or technical issues they encounter, such as those shared by Chuang Ma on CKAN installation challenges.
