## Meeting Minutes
1. Mu did the introduction of our current work and problems. We reviewed the outcome in last tutorial. 

2. Chuang did the stakeholder analysis. He outlined a stakeholder analysis for a CKAN Proof of Concept project, evaluating stakeholders based on legitimacy, power, influence, immediacy, and vested interest. It highlights key stakeholders, including government agencies, citizens, data scientists, policy analysts, and academic researchers, assigning each a ranking based on these criteria. The analysis identifies essential requirements for the system, such as compliance with policy-making acts, transparency of government data, efficient data management, and access to high-quality datasets. These requirements are prioritized to ensure the project's success.

3. As a sketchy version, we divided our team into 2 groups. One do the research task about Aussie housing rent price while another team develop the visualization tool for data analysis. To be more specific, the research team will crawl the rent price data from open-sourced website and other internet source and do the brief data cleasing and imputation. Then the data would be provided to the VT team, where they will be analyzed deeper.
