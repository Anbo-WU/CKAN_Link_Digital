## Meeting Minutes

1. Analysis of the weekly tasks: 

   We conducted weekly task analysis based on the project plan provided by the client. The client reviewed in detail the tasks we completed last week and proposed the tasks that should be completed this week.

2. Project progress communication with each member:

   Songxuan Li: made some suggestions and read all the videos and documents provided by the client, but he did not understand the data analysis in the project.

   Doeun Han: presented his understanding of Project CKAN.

   Yuxin Mu: Asked about the data types that should be learned, such as traffic.

​	   Qifeng ZHENG: How to make data machine-readable.

​	   Diao Fu: How to expand the portal in CKAN.

​	   Chuang Ma: The stakeholders already be considered.

3. Client's suggestion:

   I want to see an increase in demand, possibly through any use cases that align with the values your company pursues.
   Therefore, the direction could involve analyses on particular topics using CKAN, developing various analytical tools leveraging CKAN, or even both. The critical point is to more clearly analyze where we can enhance demand in the current workflow or data pipeline. If your team can provide improvements in those areas, I believe it would be beneficial. 

4. The groups formed freely and discussed the operability of specific CKAN program development and the writing of CKAN data processing reports.
