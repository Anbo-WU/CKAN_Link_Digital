## Meeting Minutes
1. The professor told us the difference between what’s for the team and what’s for the project. Then he told us the function of shadow team. We need to communicate with our shadow team well.

2. When we evaluate other team members or the members of our shadow team, we can not just give average mark to all. We need to be ‘brutal’, to some extent. It is the necessary process to evaluate objectively.

3. The professor said we need to follow the engineering process. We need to complete the Weekly Report and Tutorial Agenda in time and update all the action into team repository. It is not negotiable.

4. Mu introduced our landing page and our decision making during the last week. He introduced the obligation of our 3 sub-teams and backlog in the short-term future.

5. Our shadow team: Chatbot showed their weekly update. They do well in report recording, issue interacting and coding ameliorating. We need to study from them.
