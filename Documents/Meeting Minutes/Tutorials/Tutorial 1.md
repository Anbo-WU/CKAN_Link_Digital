## Meeting Minutes
1. Project introduction in the order of: Chatbot -> News aggregator -> Accelerating -> Dragonfly thinking
2. The work plan of Chatbot for this semester:
   1. build a data warehouse to better confirm the relationship,
   2. link it to Chatbot,
   3. clean the data,
   4. move all left documents to Gitlab,
   5. may use the server given by the client.
3. QA section of Chatbot:
   1. the difficulty in last semester: conflict on project management tool -> move all documents from Notion to Gitlab
   2. the relationship with client so far: not that deep but satisfy with progress -> in-person instead of online for this semester  
      (suggestion from tutor: rotate who will attend meetings in each week instead of all members if there are many meetings each week)
   3. the risk in last semester: lose contact with one member
   4. how to measure success: satisfy the client and need to know what they care in priority
   5. why choose Gitlab instead of Notion in the end: task arrangement and completion time is visible
4. Suggestions from tutor for a startup team like us:
   1. First thing to do: what are all the things and their priorities, familiar with client's product
   2. Main work for next week: SOW, charter, general contribution
      (suggestion: something may be unknown for now, just focus on important things and not to rewrite)
   3. Labour division need to adapt to the need of clients (traditional division may be unapplicable for some case)
   4. Objectives need to be measurable (for example, "improve" is not good to use)
   5. Risk management is important  
      (For example, how to define when someone's work is done -> commitments on the website or?
      what to do when something is never done before -> negotiate with the client and analyse what may impact a problem and what we can do for now)
   6. Assessment may focus on the continuous progress
      (Evidence is important, such as emails with the client, achievements of our analysis and development, while long-page documents may not be valued)
5. Arrangements for next tutorial: mark repos of shadow team
