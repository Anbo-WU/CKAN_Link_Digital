## 2. Discussion and Decisions

### 2.1 Review of Client meeting 
- **Key point**: After a week of analyzing CKAN and discussing with the client, our team agreed to create a data analysis report on the rise in house rental prices in Australia due to the influx of international students. Additionally, we decided to explore various ways to visualize the analysis results.
- **Action Item**: To achieve this, the team will pre-explore several research papers to understand specific datasets and analysis methods, and then revisit these findings for further discussion.

### 2.2 Finalizing the scope of project
- **Key point**: Considering that the entire project is a year-long endeavor, our team has decided to establish the project phases across two semesters. In the first semester, we will extract and analyze various datasets from CKAN to create use cases, focusing on generating analysis reports and visualizations. During this process, we will also conduct a functional analysis of CKAN, with the aim of exploring its practical expansion in the second semester.
- **Action Item**: We have decided to reflect this overall direction in the SOW and the project roadmap on Git.(by Doeun Han,[restructuring of Git_issue#17](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/issues/17), [revision of SOW_issue#18](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/issues/18) 

### 2.2 Review of Audit 1 result
- **Key point**: As a result of gathering feedback from the tutor and the shadow team after Audit 1, it was revealed that our team's current progress is very insufficient. Specifically, the projectâ€™s concrete direction is unclear, and the role allocation in the team charter is ambiguous. Additionally, we received comments that there was nothing particularly noteworthy in terms of project management.
- **Action Item**: In response, our team agreed to upgrade the SOW and team charter, and to implement various management strategies such as decision logs, risk management, and project roadmap management.(by Doeun Han,[restructuring of Git_issue#17](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/issues/17), [revision of SOW_issue#18](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/issues/18)
