## 2. Discussion and Decisions

### 2.1 Review of Client meeting 
- **Key point**: Initially, the client only expressed a desire to expand CKAN and its ecosystem without providing specific requirements. However, in today’s meeting with the client, they shared that they are open to any form of project. In other words, it doesn’t necessarily have to involve product development; as long as the work aligns with the values of their company, they are fine with it. 
- **Action Item**: we decided to further explore various options, such as creating data analysis reports or enhancing data visualizations.

### 2.2 Scoping the project details
- **Key point**: Next week, we plan to further refine the project and analyze various aspects of the ecosystem, including inbound, operation, and outbound elements, before finalizing the project direction. We will also conduct a detailed stakeholder analysis to carefully consider the specific direction. 
- **Action Item**: The team will be divided into two groups: one group will focus on a detailed analysis of the ecosystem, while the other group will carry out the stakeholder analysis.

## 3. Action Items Summary
1. Finalize the detailed project direction through a thorough analysis of the CKAN ecosystem and stakeholders.
