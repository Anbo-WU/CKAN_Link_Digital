# Decision Matrix

## 1. Overview

A Decision Matrix is a tool used to make the best choice among multiple alternatives. This method involves setting evaluation criteria, scoring each option according to these criteria, and then applying weights to ultimately select the alternative with the highest total score.

## 2. Objective

The objectives of a Decision Matrix are:

- **Objective Decision-Making**: It helps to avoid emotional or intuitive decisions by relying on quantitative data for objective judgments.
- **Efficient Comparison**: It allows for a side-by-side comparison of multiple alternatives, simplifying complex decision-making processes.
- **Incorporating Weights**: By assigning weights to each evaluation criterion, the matrix ensures that more important factors are given more influence in the final decision.

## 3. Method

1. **List Alternatives**: Enumerate all the alternatives under consideration.
2. **Set Evaluation Criteria**: Establish the criteria by which each alternative will be evaluated.
3. **Assign Weights**: Assign a weight to each evaluation criterion based on its importance.
4. **Score Alternatives**: Rate each alternative according to the evaluation criteria.
5. **Calculate Total Score**: Multiply the scores by the weights and sum them to get the final score for each alternative.
6. **Make a Decision**: Choose the alternative with the highest total score.

## 4. Evaluation Criteria Explanation

Below are some key evaluation criteria that can be used in a Decision Matrix, along with their descriptions.

| **Evaluation Criteria** | **Description**                                                                                   |
