| D001            |17-08-2024               | Establish the concrete direction of the project:Phase 1 (First Semester): Create a data analysis report and perform visualizations using CKAN, while conducting an analysis of CKAN's strengths and weaknesses. Phase 2 (Second Semester): Based on the analysis of CKAN's strengths and weaknesses, carry out improvement tasks.                     |All members and client                |completed (Concrete agreement on the project's direction, which was previously lacking, with the client. |[Reflected in the SOW](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fh2WZWSEAQ5dce1w1dczv8Jm8RzKnK3JNiipDiokF7c/edit) . )     |
| D002      |  18-08-2024             |Adjustment of R&R within the team: Doeun Han & SongXuan Li (Co-Project Managers), Yuxin Mu (Technical Leader).                       | All members               | Due to the absence of initial project management, the team received a low score in Audit 1. To strengthen management moving forward, R&R has been adjusted. Additional roles will be assigned to other team members as the project progresses.                    |Completed ([Team Charter updated](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/Documents/Admin/Accelerating%20-%20Team%20Charter%20-%20Final.pdf)).        |
| D003            | 20-08-2024    |etermination of Decision-Making Method and Its Application for Changing the Data Analysis Report Topic | All Members and client |During the task execution, we identified limitations in the initial project’s analysis methods. This has led to a need to decide whether to continue with the current approach or explore alternatives. A comparison with other topics is necessary to make an informed decision. Additionally, the importance of having a concrete decision-making process has become evident.| Completed(The topic selection has been finalized through this analysis) [Analysis Results](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/Documents/Decision%20Log/Decision%20Analysis.md)       |
|D004|19-08-2024|Decided to use Python for data collection|Yuxin Mu|Python has been chosen because it is less challenging to program compared to Java or C, and it offers a more comprehensive set of libraries for data collection and processing. Additionally, since Python is widely used for data collection in the industry, we will have access to more guidance and readily available solutions when facing challenges.|Completed|
| D005     | 21-08-2024 |It has been decided to install CKAN on only one computer. | Yuxin Mu | Since installing and configuring CKAN takes a significant amount of time, it will be installed on a single computer, and a virtual machine will be set up to allow access from other computers. | Completed|
|D006|21-08-2024|decided to collect the following data from Domain: weekly rental price, bond amount, property type (apartment/unit/flat), location, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of parking spaces, property features such as internal laundry and dishwasher, and the number of schools in the area.|Yuxin Mu, Anbo Wu, Diao Fu|This is considered the most essential data for analyzing the topic.|Completed|
|D006|26-08-2024|Unlike GitHub, which only allows managing a single issue board, GitLab enables the creation of multiple issue boards, making issue management more intuitive and efficient. Therefore, we are considering migrating to GitLab.|All members|We decided to continue using GitHub for the project, as moving the current repository would be inefficient given the limited time remaining.|Completed|
| D007        | 31-08-2024    | Selected Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) due to the free tier offering sufficient resources for the CKAN demo over Google Cloud and AWS. | Chaung Ma       | OCI provided better OCPU and memory compared to other cloud providers. | The result is available for review here.[Completed](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/CKAN%20Learning%20Outcome%20Files/CKAN%20Practical%20Report.pdf)   |
| D008        | 31-08-2024    | Chose Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as the operating system for CKAN for its stability and strong community support. | Chaung Ma       | Ubuntu was preferred over CentOS and Red Hat for its reliable support. | The result is available for review here.[Completed](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/CKAN%20Learning%20Outcome%20Files/CKAN%20Practical%20Report.pdf)   |
| D009        | 02-09-2024    | Changed the default port from 80 to 8888 to enhance security and avoid potential attacks. | Chaung Ma       | Security was prioritized by avoiding the widely used port 80. | The result is available for review here.[Completed](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/CKAN%20Learning%20Outcome%20Files/CKAN%20Practical%20Report.pdf)   |
| D010        | 04-09-2024    | Selected CKAN modules like datatables_view and geo_view for data visualization based on project needs. | Chaung Ma      | Chose modules that best matched project requirements after thorough review. | The result is available for review here.[Completed](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/CKAN%20Learning%20Outcome%20Files/CKAN%20Practical%20Report.pdf)   |
| D011        | 04-09-2024    | Decided to install CKAN from source for greater control over the installation process and better understanding of system architecture. | Chuang Ma, Anbo Wu, Diao Fu, Qifeng Zheng       | Source installation allowed more flexibility and system optimization. | The result is available for review here.[Completed](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/CKAN%20Learning%20Outcome%20Files/CKAN%20Practical%20Report.pdf)    |
| D012        | 11-09-2024    | Adjusted the file upload limit in the CKAN configuration file to address the issue of uploading large files. | Anbo Wu     | Flexibility in adjusting the settings to suit the project’s needs. | The result is available for review here.[Completed](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/CKAN%20Learning%20Outcome%20Files/CKAN%20Practical%20Report.pdf)    |
| D013        | 18-09-2024    | Disabled the multilingual plugin temporarily due to conflicts with the search function. | Qifeng Zheng       | Prioritized search functionality stability, with plans to resolve the conflict later. | The result is available for review here.[Completed](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/CKAN%20Learning%20Outcome%20Files/CKAN%20Practical%20Report.pdf)   |
| D014        | 22-09-2024    | Modified CORS settings to allow all origins for loading Pie and Line charts, but identified the need for more secure settings in production. | Chaung Ma       | Decided to enable smoother data visualization during development, with plans for security enhancements. | The result is available for review here.[Completed](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/CKAN%20Learning%20Outcome%20Files/CKAN%20Practical%20Report.pdf)   |
