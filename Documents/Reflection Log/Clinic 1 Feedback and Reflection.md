## Session Overview
- **Date & Location:** 26-08-2024 14:00~15:00 at Hive
- **Participants:** Shayne Flint, Yuxin Mu, Doeun Han

## Key Topics
### **Main Focus**
 - **Uncertainty about whether the client wants the project to continue**
 - **General review of current project management**

## Insights & Next Steps
### **Key Takeaways**
 - **If there are specific aspects of the collaboration with the client that you want to clarify and resolve, speak to the Convenor to ensure appropriate actions are taken.**
 - **Overall, the management on GitHub is too scattered, making it difficult to understand intuitively.**
 - **Milestones were found in the Roadmap file, but it is necessary to create and manage milestones directly within Git.**
 - **Various files, such as the Team Charter, SOW, current landing page, and GitHub, are scattered. They need to be organized.**
 - **Standardize all file formats in Markdown to facilitate consistent documentation and management.**
 - **Some meeting minutes are unclear, and key points are hard to grasp. They need to be written more clearly.**
 - **A starter kit has already been provided in GitLab. It allows for more intuitive and efficient task management compared to GitHub. It appears that too many documents are currently being created in GitHub. Simplify the process by managing tasks through the issue board.**
 - **Don't be afraid if certain parts are not progressing well. It’s important to recognize the problem clearly and demonstrate improvement. However, face the issue quickly, seek solutions, and document the process thoroughly. That’s the key.**

### **Future Actions** 
 - **Discussed with team members the need for action regarding collaboration issues with the client.**
 - **Created milestones within Git.**
 - **Deleted duplicate files from the landing page and within Git.**
 - **Standardized file formats to Markdown.**
 - **Ensured future minutes are written clearly and concisely to convey key points effectively.**
 - **Discussed with team members the possibility of transitioning to GitLab.**
