Reflection of issues in Data Cleaning Task 

## Background
The Data Cleaning task is to clean the collected raw data. For detail can be seen from  
https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning/Summary%20of%20Data%20Cleaning.md
The sub-task4 of  Data Cleaning had a issue which is that the 'resulted' dataset has price of 1,2,3,4 dollor per week. This issue was obvious but was not identified by anyone of this team. Therefore, Yuxin Mu, who is in charge of data cleaning task, will conduct a reflection on the reasons why the mistake has not been identified by the team and what improvement and action should be taken in future

## Reflection
After reviewing, the main reasons of this issue are: 
1. the team members only perform part of the data cleaning process rather than the whole data cleaning process. In this process, all missing values were identified. However, the team members did not fully consider the invalid value problem and they only ensured the value in attribute price is numerical. However, the value in price can be numerical and invalid. For instance, some renal postings did not post real data about price. Instead, they use number from 1 - 4.
2. The person in charge of the data cleaning task did not perform the testing and checking process.

After understanding the reasons of this issue, the following improvement should be conducted : 
1. In the future work, each member should conduct work under the full standards without bypassing steps.
2. In the future work, the person in charge of the task should conduct the following steps after the task is completed:
-  Communicate with other members about how they conduct the work
-  check for any problem or issue in their logic
-  check for the final work to ensure there is no issue
