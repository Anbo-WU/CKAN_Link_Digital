Reflection and Plan for Improvement from audit 1

1. Project Output

Reflection:
The feedback highlights the need for greater clarity and detail in our project documentation. Our Statement of Work (SOW) and team charter lack specific definitions and a clear explanation of our proof of concept. The limited content in our repository also indicates that our progress isn't well-documented or communicated.

Plan for Improvement:

 - Clarify the SOW: We will revise our problem statement to clearly define the proof of concept, outlining its purpose and expected outcomes. We will also provide more context on the client's expectations and how we plan to meet them. (Completed_Made new version of it [SOW](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/Documents/Admin/Statement%20of%20Work_First%20Semester_Final.pdf))
 - Complete the Team Charter: The team charter will be updated with clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and a plan for maturing the artefacts. We'll ensure it reflects the current status and future plans. (Completed_reflected feedback and corrected some part of it[Team Charter](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/Documents/Admin/Accelerating%20-%20Team%20Charter%20-%20Final.pdf)
 - Enhance Repository Documentation: We will commit to regularly updating the repository with all relevant files and documentation, including research and preparatory work. This will include a clear timeline and evidence of progress.(Compledted_restructured github [Issue#17](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/issues/17))

2. Decision-Making

Reflection:
Our decision-making process is underdeveloped, with only a basic decision register in place. We need a more structured approach, particularly in distinguishing between minor and major decisions and ensuring client involvement where necessary.

Plan for Improvement:

 - Develop a Decision-Making Framework: We will create a more detailed structure for capturing decisions, categorizing them by complexity. This framework will outline when client approval is required and how decisions should be documented.(Completed_made [decision matrix](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/Documents/Decision%20Log/Decision%20Analysis.md))
 - Enhance the Decision Register: The decision register will be updated to include a rationale for each decision and a clear process for client agreement. This will also be incorporated into our handover documentation.(Completed_made [decision log](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/Documents/Decision%20Log/Decision%20Log.md) and 
updated it regularly in [Project Roadmap](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/Documents/Project%20Roadmap/Project%20Roadmap.md))
 - Client Agreement on Decision Boundaries: We will work with the client to agree on which decisions can be made independently by the team and which require their input, ensuring that this is clearly documented.(Compledted_recorded each case in decision log)

3. Teamwork
Reflection:
Our teamwork processes are currently unclear, with undefined roles, limited visibility of tasks, and a lack of documentation regarding internal meetings and client interactions. This makes it difficult to assess how we are collaborating and progressing.

Plan for Improvement:

 - Define Roles and Responsibilities: We will finalize and document the roles and responsibilities of each team member in the team charter, including decision-making boundaries.
Improve Task Tracking: We will implement a more detailed task tracking system that clearly shows what each team member is working on, including the assignment of points to tasks. This will ensure transparency and accountability within the team.(Completed_Done analysis on R&R for team member [analysis report](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/Documents/Risk%20Management/Teamwork%20Analysis.md)
 - Document Internal Processes: A record of all internal meetings, task assignments, and responses to client requests will be maintained. This will include detailed meeting minutes and action items.(Keep recording it through all minutes including team, client, shadow, and tutorial meeting)
   
4. Stakeholder Engagement

Reflection:
While we have made a good start in communicating with stakeholders, there is a need for better documentation and communication practices, particularly in ensuring that our status reports and risk management are visible and accessible.

Plan for Improvement:

 - Develop Meeting Agendas: We will create and publish standing meeting agendas for both internal and client meetings, ensuring that key topics such as “Decisions Required” and “Risks/Issues” are consistently addressed.(Keep doing this with writing status report every week)
 - Maintain Risk and Issue Register: A current Risk and Issue Register will be maintained and regularly updated. All identified risks and issues will be documented and tracked in a visible manner, with assigned project manager and due dates.(Completed_Made [risk log](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/Documents/Risk%20Management/Risk%20List.md) and managed thoroughly issues on the git)
 - Improve Communication with Client: We will ensure that status reports and relevant documentation are consistently shared with the client, and we will provide them with access to our communication channels, such as Slack.(In progress_discussing which way we are going to choose since we thought regular meeting and channel in the Facebook is enough. However, it is still needed to visualize our communication progress, so we are talking with client shortly. We have discussed, but not decided yet.)

5. Reflection

Reflection:
We have demonstrated self-awareness but need to formalize our reflection process to continually assess and improve our project and team structure.

Plan for Improvement:

 - Implement a Reflection Log: We will dedicate time to reflect on our progress, capturing our thoughts in a reflection log. This will help us identify what is working well and what needs improvement.(Completed_we have made directory for reflection log, and trace its progress. However, it is not intuitive, so we are going to switch this to Gitlab for intuitive management after team members' consents)
 - Continuous Improvement: The reflection log will be used to regularly review and adjust our project and team processes, ensuring that we are continuously improving and adapting to any challenges we encounter.
This structured approach to reflection and improvement will help us address the feedback provided and enhance the effectiveness of our project and teamwork.
