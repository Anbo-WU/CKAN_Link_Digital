# Project Feedback Summary

## 1. Project Output
### **Client Feedback:**
- The team has adapted well to the unique opportunity but hasn’t applied the proposed value-delivery methods to their outputs.
- The client’s value is being realized but needs to be properly captured in deliverables.

### **Tutor Feedback:**
- Limited evidence of outputs in the repository, with files stored in alternative locations.
- No clear evidence of CKAN deployment or project progress.
- Focus needed on capturing learnings, engaging with CKAN community, and demonstrating CKAN's value.
- If data scraping isn’t viable, alternative value delivery options must be explored.

### **Shadow Team Feedback:**
- Mmore documentation needed in the repository.
- Client work is valuable, but more innovation and future needs anticipation required.
- More outputs should be delivered to meet expectations.
- A data generation code issue was identified, requiring improvement.

### **Reflection on Project Output:**
To improve project output, the team needs to better capture and document the value delivered to the client. By centralizing outputs in the repository, we can better align our work with client and stakeholder expectations.

### **Action Plan:**
- Centralize all deliverables in the repository for transparency and easier evaluation.
  > We created [reports](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/tree/main/CKAN%20Learning%20Outcome%20Files) and managed [issues](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/issues) in Git for this purpose.
- Address the data generation code issue and improve output quality.
  > [Result : Improved data collection and data quality check](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/tree/main/Data%20Cleaning)
- Increase engagement with the CKAN community.
  > [Result : The link of the plan](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/Documents/Tasks/Plans%20of%20engaging%20in%20CKAN%20community.md)

## 2. Decision Making
### **Client Feedback:**
- The team has been diligent in representing stakeholders but has faced challenges in doing so.
- Their resolve and commitment to taking feedback have been essential to their success.

### **Tutor Feedback:**
- The risk register has unclear ownership and needs refinement.
- Decision-making and accountability need to be improved, especially in critical risk areas like data scraping.

### **Shadow Team Feedback:**
- Some items in the risk management plan are not actual risks, and the decision log is lacking detail.
- The decision-making process is scientific but needs more diverse perspectives and outcome evaluations.

### **Reflection on Decision Making:**
The team must refine its risk management process, ensuring clear ownership of each risk. By documenting the rationale behind key decisions and including diverse perspectives, the team can enhance our decision-making process.

### **Action Plan:**
- Clearly assign ownership for each risk and refine the risk register to avoid ambiguities.
  > [Result : Clear responsibility assignments were made.](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/Documents/Risk%20Management/Risk%20List.md)
- Document the rationale behind key decisions in the decision log to ensure transparency.
  > [Result :To demonstrate the process and outcomes of decisions, we attached documents for each risk.]{https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/Documents/Decision%20Log/Decision%20Log.md)
- Include diverse perspectives in decision-making to improve the evaluation process.
  > [Result : We made an effort to include diverse perspectives by sharing all decisions not only with team members but also during client meetings.](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/Documents/Decision%20Log/Decision%20Log.md)
- Revisit critical risks, like data scraping, and create contingency plans.
  > [Result : We missed that issue, but have now provided an update regarding it.](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/Documents/Risk%20Management/Risk%20List.md)

## 3. Teamwork
### **Client Feedback:**
- The team has good cohesion but lacks internal coordination, leading to some misalignment with client expectations.

### **Tutor Feedback:**
- Significant improvements in the repository, but tickets need regular updates.
- Ensure stakeholders can connect to the CKAN system for testing and Provide detailed instructions for connecting and using the system.

### **Shadow Team Feedback:**
- Roles and responsibilities within the team are unclear, and internal communication could be improved.
- The team collaborates well, but there are gaps in understanding individual progress.

### **Reflection on Teamwork:**
The team should focus on clarifying roles and responsibilities and improving internal communication to ensure better coordination and progress tracking. A dedicated issue board and regular check-ins will help align team efforts.

### **Action Plan:**
- Define roles and responsibilities clearly and ensure all team members understand their tasks.
  > [Result : We review each task and clearly assign responsibility through weekly team meetings.](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/tree/main/Documents/Meeting%20Minutes/Team)
- Set up an issue board to track progress and deadlines.
  > [Result : we managed issue board](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/issues)
- Hold regular team meetings to review individual progress and ensure alignment with project goals.
  > [Result : We review each task and clearly assign responsibility through weekly team meetings.]
- Create a comprehensive guide that includes step-by-step instructions for connecting to and using the CKAN system.
  > [Result : We created the relevant guide.](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/tree/main/Documents/Ckan%20install%20and%20demonstration)

## 4. Stakeholder Engagement
### **Client Feedback:**
- The team has been highly sensitive to the client’s needs and adaptive to stakeholder value, despite struggling.

### **Tutor Feedback:**
- The team needs to increase communication frequency with the client and demonstrate that meeting minutes are reviewed and approved.

### **Shadow Team Feedback:**
- Stakeholder engagement is strong, but proactive feedback and a more structured engagement strategy could strengthen relationships.

### **Reflection on Stakeholder Engagement:**
The team should focus on engaging more proactively with stakeholders and ensure that all interactions are documented. Increasing the frequency of communication with the client and demonstrating approval of meeting minutes will improve transparency and trust.

### **Action Plan:**
- Increase communication frequency with the client, using informal channels (e.g., chat) for quicker updates.
  > [Result : we have been communicating with client via issue board like this](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/issues/66)
- Demonstrate client approval of meeting minutes to ensure alignment.
  > [Resulst : We obtain approval from the client both before and after each weekly meeting.](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/issues/67) [another example](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/issues/62)
- Strengthen stakeholder engagement by seeking more proactive feedback and adjusting approaches based on that feedback.
- Ensure that all interactions with stakeholders are documented and acted upon.
  >[Result : We primarily communicated with the relevant stakeholders by providing feedback on CkanGPT for the two tasks mentioned above.](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/CKAN%20Learning%20Outcome%20Files/Experience_%20CKANGPT_Report.pdf)

## 5. Reflection
### **Client Feedback:**
- The team’s commitment and resolve in reflecting and improving based on feedback are seen as valuable.

### **Tutor Feedback:**
- The reflection log lacks evidence of changes made based on feedback, and Engineering logs are needed to track progress.

### **Shadow Team Feedback:**
- Reflection has improved but needs more measurable objectives and updates for collaboration and task assignments.

### **Reflection on Reflection:**
The team should enhance their reflection process by setting clear, measurable objectives and documenting changes based on feedback. Introducing Engineering logs will help track progress and ensure continuous improvement.

### **Action Plan:**
- Transform the reflection log from a meeting summary into a more robust record of changes made based on reflections.
  > Result : We made an effort to document various reflections, just as we have recorded the outcomes in this document.
- Introduce Engineering logs to track technical and individual progress.
- Set clear, measurable objectives for improvement and document any changes based on reflections.
  > Result : The outcomes of our actions on the reflections can be verified in this document, just as we have recorded all other results.
