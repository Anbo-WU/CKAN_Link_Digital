## Team Rules

### Team Meetings
- Team meetings are held weekly on Saturdays at 3 PM.
- Meetings involving the client will only occur if there is a set agenda, prepared and shared at least 24 hours in advance.
- Any team member can propose and contribute to the meeting agenda.

### General Rules
- **Language:** All communications within the team should be conducted in English.
- **Respect and Professionalism:** Treat all team members with respect and maintain a professional demeanor.
- **Responsibility:** Complete your assigned tasks on time. Be prepared to explain your work to the team, client, and Techlauncher staff when necessary. Notify the team in advance if you are unable to meet a deadline, and seek help early if needed after making a reasonable effort to resolve issues independently.
- **Delegation:** If a team member needs to be absent from a meeting or tutorial, they must notify the team at least 24 hours in advance and make arrangements for another member to cover their responsibilities. This can be done by preparing records/documents or communicating the necessary information verbally.
- **Communication:** Actively share ideas and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to contribute. Speak up about concerns or suggestions at the earliest convenience to allow for timely resolution of any conflicts or frustrations.
- **Responsiveness:** Enable notifications for the main communication platforms (WeChat, Slack, Messenger, and Email) and check messages daily. Respond to messages where you are mentioned and team decision messages within 24 hours. Acknowledge reading important messages or announcements with an appropriate emoji reaction if necessary.

## Decision Making Process
- Decisions will be made by majority vote. Members who abstain from voting will be considered neutral.
- In the case of a tie, the client will make the final decision after weighing the pros and cons.

## Task Assignment and Tracking
- Non-coding tasks (e.g., decisions, reflection logging, writing SOW) should be documented in the weekly meeting minutes.
- Development/coding tasks will be assigned and tracked using GitHub Projects and GitHub Issues.
- GitHub Issues should have a clear and concise title and a detailed description, including a brief summary and a bullet-point list of tasks required to complete the issue.

## Weekly Progress Report
- The "Progress Report" section in the weekly meeting minutes will replace stand-up meetings. Team members should document their achievements from the previous week (linking to GitHub issues if applicable) and outline their plans for the upcoming week in this section.

## Evaluation Process
- **Feedback:** Team members should provide detailed and constructive feedback for their peers. At a minimum, feedback should include one positive aspect and one area for improvement, if applicable.
- **Evaluation:** In the team's self-evaluation tag report, a rating of 5 out of 5 indicates complete satisfaction with the outputs of assigned tasks. Satisfaction is measured against the task's acceptance criteria, as agreed upon by the entire team and the client. Lower ratings can be given based on the degree to which tasks do not meet these criteria.
- **Focus:** Feedback and ratings should concentrate on members' contributions and overall attitude. Minor infractions, such as being late to a meeting, should not result in a reduced rating unless they significantly impact performance and contribution.
- **Task Transfer:** A member’s contribution should be evaluated based on the outcome of their assigned tasks. If a member is absent from a meeting, they should arrange for another team member to report on their tasks (referred to as “task transfer”). If the transfer is adequately prepared, the absent member’s rating should not be negatively affected. However, if the transfer is insufficient, it may impact the team's ability to respond to stakeholders' questions, which can affect the absent member’s rating.
- **Awareness:** All team members should be aware of each other's work to enhance project comprehension and facilitate accurate evaluations. If unsure about another member's tasks, team members should seek clarification directly from them before assessing their contributions.
- **Justification:** Ratings below 5 out of 5 must include:
  - Detailed comments explaining the reasons for the rating
  - Suggestions for improvement
  - Ratings without these elements, or with misleading or false information, will not be accepted. This can be verified using the team’s majority voting system.
- **Integrity:** Manipulation of grades through the "team contribution" tag report is prohibited. For instance, unjustifiably low ratings given intentionally will prompt an investigation involving the examiner and convener, especially if a majority of the team agrees that there is a discrepancy between the rating and the actual work observed during the sprint.
- **Warning:** Each team member must receive a written warning for "insufficient team contribution" before being downgraded in the tag report. A warning will be issued upon agreement of four or more team members. The team leader is responsible for sending out the warning, unless the team leader is the one lacking contribution, in which case another member will be elected to send the warning.

## Conflict Resolution Process
- **Immediate Addressal:** Address conflicts as soon as they arise to prevent escalation.
- **Direct Resolution:** The involved parties should first attempt to resolve the conflict independently and peacefully by identifying the root cause.
- **Team Involvement:** If direct resolution fails, bring the issue to the entire team for resolution.
- **Confidential Resolution:** If the above steps do not work or the parties wish to keep the matter confidential, they should escalate the issue to Techlauncher staff, following the order: clinic, tutor, examiner, and then convener. The team should be notified about the existence and nature of the conflict.
- **Documentation:** Document all steps of conflict resolution, including discussions and outcomes, to ensure transparency and provide learning opportunities.
- **Anonymous Feedback:** Allow for anonymous feedback on the conflict resolution process to continually improve the team's conflict management.
