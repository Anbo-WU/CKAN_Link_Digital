Achievements since last tutorial:
1.	First Meeting: After our initial tutorial on Friday, we had our first meeting with the client on Saturday. The agenda was to discuss the detailed progress of the project. During this discussion, we identified differing expectations between the client and us. The client hoped that students would present new ideas to showcase the scalability of their technology within Canberra, while we were expecting more specific requirements from the client. We mentioned that we still do not fully understand the client's technology to propose new ideas. Hence, in the first meeting, the client focused on explaining their technology, and he agreed to provide more specific requirements by the next Tuesday (6th August).
2.	Agreement Process: On Monday (5th August), the client apologized to our tutor for not being able to present specific requirements, which led our team to submit only a draft SOW. The client provided material outlining the project direction on Tuesday. However, the client still emphasized wanting students to propose new ideas rather than providing detailed development needs or directions. The client proposed that for the next two weeks, our team should learn about their CKAN technology and workflow, discovering new value within this framework. Further discussions on this matter have yet to take place, and we plan to consolidate our opinions and reach an agreement on the future tasks in a meeting with the client next Saturday.
3.	Audit 1 Preparation: For Audit 1 preparation, the Team Charter was handled by Anbo, Yuxin, and Songxuan, while the SOW was managed by Doeun, Diao, and Chuang. The landing page was created by Qifeng. All team members completed their assigned tasks within the designated period, and we were able to prepare for Audit 1 without any issues. However, since there was no specific agreement with the client regarding the tasks, we could only draft a general direction for the SOW. Our team plans to first agree on the overall aspects the client desires from our new ideas and, once we have identified new value, we will draft a more detailed SOW for further agreement.

RISK
1.	Time Management: Although the tutor advised that it is better to thoroughly deliberate and start the tasks without a specific content or direction, our team is concerned about not having defined specific tasks even by the third week. There is significant concern about whether we can complete the tasks within the designated period of the semester. Therefore, we plan to discuss these concerns with the client in future meetings to set a concrete timeline for the tasks and improve the projectâ€™s completion within the given timeframe.
