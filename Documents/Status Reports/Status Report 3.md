### Weekly Report
**Date**: August 22, 2024 
**Team/Department**: Accelerating 
### Progress Since Last Tutorial: 
**Setting of the research topic**: the research topic is set to be the about rental market. Currently, we are going to study and quantify the increase of rental price in Australia that is caused by increase of number of international students.  

**Research work and findings**: the team need to conduct research on this topic. Therefore, after looking through hundreds of essays, 6 essays regrading rental market were chosen as part of the tasks of this week. 4 persons in this team were assigned 1 or 3 papers. After, these team members reviewed the papers and concluded a summary, we discussed about the papers. It was found that there are rarely any essay focusing on this area. Therefore, the feasibility of this topic is a problem. Two options are provided including switching to another similar topic.   

**Dataset collection**: One team member conducted the collection of dataset. In this stage, we focused on the collection of dataset that is available on the internet. A report regarding description of these dataset is generated. Based on the discussion of research findings, it is possible that the datasets available in the internet are not suitable for the research topic, and collecting data by using web crawler is needed in the future.  

**Research publishing**: one team member worked on considering how to present our research results and generated a report. 

**Repository restructure and update missed documentation**: Based on the analysis of the Audit 1 results, one of our member restructured the Git documentation management system to enhance project management. He have written several documents that were previously missed, including updates to the minutes of team meetings. To manage the overall progress of the project and ensure continuous tracking, he created a Project Roadmap. Additionally, he prepared a Decision Log and a Risk Log to facilitate more meticulous project management. 

**Optimization of SOW**: As the team project tasks became more concrete, some of team members refined the project's goals, problem analysis, plan, and milestones in the SOW to ensure meticulous project management going forward. We plan to finalize and sign off on these with the client by the end of this week. 

### Goals for the Next Phase: 

**Set up CKAN environment**: When setting up the environment, we need to ask the permission code from Link Digital to make specific functions of CKAN available. One team member will make sure everyone can access CKAN and the environment is stable. 

**Get suitable data**: Some team members will use Python to crawler from online resources to get available data. 

**Prepare for Audit 2**: Prepare for the Audit 2 presentation, and add the missed part of our repository. Checking the criteria of Audit 2, to reflect how could we modify our project management in the future. 

### Current Risks: 

**Timing of this project**: We may need to make more progress in the following weeks and quatify our tasks to make sure the project could be finished on time. 

**Tasks allocation**: Currently, our tasks are most allocated to multi-people, which may be vague to tracked back the progress.
