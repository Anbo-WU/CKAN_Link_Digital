| Risk ID | Risk Description | Risk Category | Impact | Risk Level | Mitigation Strategy | Owner | Status | Conclusion|
|---------|------------------|---------------|------------|--------|------------|---------------------|-------|--------|
|   R001      |Lack of specific tasks in the project due to the absence of concrete requirements from the client. | Operational  |  There are difficulties in the project's progress due to differing expectations between the client, who anticipated creative ideas, and the team members, who expected specific project tasks. | High |Through proactive communication with the client, adjust the differing expectations and quickly establish specific project tasks. |All |Mitigation|After three meetings with the client, we have completed the establishment of detailed tasks._[SOW](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fh2WZWSEAQ5dce1w1dczv8Jm8RzKnK3JNiipDiokF7c/edit)    |
|  R002       | Due to the lack of clear R&R within the team, timely responses to project management, including Audit 1, were not achieved. | Operational|Given the nature of group assignments, there are several members who are passively observing, leading to difficulties in the smooth progress of the project.  | High | Through internal team meetings, we have appointed a Project Manager and a Technical Leader, and their roles will facilitate the smooth progress of the project._[Decision Log D002](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/Documents/Decision%20Log/Decision%20Log.md) | Doeun Han, Songxuan Li, Yuxin Mu|Mitigation|The selection of specific management personnel has provided momentum for the project’s progress. Moving forward, it will be necessary to establish concrete roles for other members to strengthen project management. |
|R003         |It is difficult to clearly understand the specific tasks and boundaries of the project (tutor's feedback) |operational |The unclear tasks of the project hinder stakeholder understanding and can negatively impact task management within the team. |High |The team held an emergency meeting and decided to finalize the specific boundaries of the tasks. Consequently, all related documents will be updated accordingly.|Yuxin Mu| Mitigation|After an [urgent team meeting](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/Documents/Meeting%20Minutes/Team/Team%20meeting%20minutes%2020240822.docx), we discussed the relevant issues and established a more detailed direction for moving forward |
|R004 |Although we conducted an analysis focused on various data analysis methodologies for research data analysis, we were unable to find an analysis method related to the current topic. This is expected to make it difficult to quantify results through future data analysis.|Technical|The absence of an appropriate methodology fundamentally hinders the progress of future analysis tasks.|High|We plan to discuss a potential shift to a different topic in an internal team meeting and subsequently consult with the tutor based on this discussion.|Yuxin Mu|Mitigation |After discussions with the client, the topic has been refined to focus on exploring the key factors that determine rental prices in the Canberra region.|
|R005|The project’s progress is being hindered due to weak teamwork.|Operational|The progress of the project is being hampered by unclear roles and responsibilities in the detailed task execution, leading to difficulties in smooth project management|High|Through the Belbin Team Roles Analysis and DISC Behavior Types Analysis, we have gained insights into the team members' role characteristics and behavioral tendencies. This allows us to enhance the clarity of roles and responsibilities, thereby improving the detailed execution of tasks.|Doeun Han|Mitigation|Based on the [analysis results](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/Documents/Risk%20Management/Teamwork%20Analysis.md), we will assign detailed tasks within the team by aligning them with the findings from the analysis.|
|R006|Many omissions and duplicates are anticipated during the data collection process|Technical|The presence of many duplicates and omissions in the data will make future analysis challenging and could cause significant difficulties in progressing with the analysis task|Medium|We are currently reviewing methods such as a Collaborative Data Collection Plan, Regular Check-ins and Updates, and Data Segmentation|Yuxin Mu, Anbo Wu, Diao Fu|Mitigation|After completing data extraction, filtered out duplicate records through data cleaning and finalized the dataset for analysis. Rusult is [here](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning/final_cleaned_data.csv)|
|R007|Failed to extract information due to lack of access during the data extraction process for analysis|Technical|This is the foremost task in the data analysis process, and if data extraction is not possible, it will prevent the progress of subsequent tasks.|High|sought advice from a senior majoring in data science.|Anbo Wu, Yuxin Mu|Mitigation|Based on the advice received, we were able to extract the data by bypassing access restrictions, as it was for a simple analysis task and not for commercial use. Final code is [here](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/tree/main/Data%20Collection%20Result/Code/Final%20Code)|
| R008 | DNS configuration errors could result in service inaccessibility | Technical | Inability to connect the domain to the server | High | Review DNS settings thoroughly and check multiple times | Chaung Ma | Mitigation | Domain connection successfully established without issues. The result is [here](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/CKAN%20Learning%20Outcome%20Files/CKAN%20Practical%20Report.pdf) |
| R009 | Security vulnerability (using default port 80 increases security risk) | Security | Exposure to common security attacks | High | Changed port to 8888, strengthened firewall settings | Chuang Ma | Mitigation | Port change and security settings applied [here](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/CKAN%20Learning%20Outcome%20Files/CKAN%20Practical%20Report.pdf)|
| R010 | Server downtime risk (resource limitations or traffic spikes) | Operational | Possible server downtime | Medium | Utilize OCI resource monitoring and plan for instance upgrades during traffic increases | Diao Fu | Mitigation | Resource monitoring ongoing, no issues detected [here](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/CKAN%20Learning%20Outcome%20Files/CKAN%20Practical%20Report.pdf)|
| R011 | Module import errors | Technical | Errors due to missing modules during installation | Medium | Manually copy files and verify the installation process | Chuang Ma | Mitigation | Problem resolved through manual copying, further validation needed for installation [here](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/CKAN%20Learning%20Outcome%20Files/CKAN%20Practical%20Report.pdf)|
| R012 | CORS issues (data visualization loading failure) | Technical | Users unable to load data visualizations due to CORS errors | Medium | Modified CORS settings, need to improve security in the process of enhancing CKAN in the future | Chuang Ma | Mitigation | Issue resolved, further security tightening required in production environments in the future [here](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/CKAN%20Learning%20Outcome%20Files/CKAN%20Practical%20Report.pdf)|
| R013 | File upload limitation | Technical | Possible failure in uploading large data files due to resource limitations | Medium | Adjust file size limits and establish proper resource planning | Anbo Wu | Mitigation | File size limits adjusted, need for further resource management [here](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/CKAN%20Learning%20Outcome%20Files/CKAN%20Practical%20Report.pdf)|
| R014 | Search functionality issues (multilingual plugin conflicts) | Technical | Search functionality disrupted due to plugin conflicts | Medium | Temporarily disabled multilingual plugin | Qifeng Zheng | Mitigation | Issue resolved with temporary plugin deactivation, permanent solution required in the process of improvement of CKAN [here](https://github.com/DiaoFu/Accelerating/blob/main/CKAN%20Learning%20Outcome%20Files/CKAN%20Practical%20Report.pdf) |
