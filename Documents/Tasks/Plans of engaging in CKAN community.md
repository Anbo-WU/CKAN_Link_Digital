## Gitter: main communication method
According to the official website of CKAN, gitter is the most frequently used communication method with Q&A and getting help. There may be several things we can do here as follows. During developing our own project, we may encounter problems and we can post it to get help in time. Gitter is a communication tool in a way like chatting, so that the problem may get a timely solution and the process of out project can be accelerated. In addition, we can invite contributors there to respond or comment for our outcome of data analysis so that we can update and improve our project in a more accepted way. 

## Github Discussions: find trends on techs
Except Gitter, discussions are also going on on the Github. Discussions here focus more on the development sections instead of daily Q&A. Therefore, we can check monthly development updates there and follow what kind of tech people think is suitable to combine with CKAN. There are already some interesting trends in the discussion stack now, such as custom plugin/theme and enhanced machine learning dataset support in CKAN. In the process, we can find one and dive into it and discuss it with contributors there. 

## Google meeting of CKAN community: keep pace with the newest update
There are two weekly google meetings open to anyone. We could try to attend one and reflect on what value it would give for this project. 
The link of the meeting would be updated weekly in this link: https://github.com/ckan/ckan/wiki/Weekly-Developer-Meetings

## Stackoverflow: additional channel for searching help
After generated AI such as Chatgpt is widely used by people to learn new things, Stackoverflow is a little bit less used than before. However, there are still some valuable answers there for beginners. Besides, Chatgpt may have few ideas about certain questions and we can search for help there. 

## Github: make contributions to CKAN repo itself if time and ability allows
There are 133 open issues in the github repo of CKAN now (12/09/2024), and some of them might could be solved by us, such as cleanning data or testing. For example, issue #8189 clean activity history command/action and issue #8142 nightly test with realistic data, performance measurements correspond to this two kinds of tasks respectively. Therefore, we can review the repository to try and understand demand for feature requests. 

## Student community: create a new CKAN community via student media if time allows
There are newspapers published by ANU students' communities. We might invite a reporter to draft a article to introduce open-source data management system with CKAN.
