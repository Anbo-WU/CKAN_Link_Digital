# Task Detail  
Identify workflows in public sector policy-making that can benefit from improved data management and analysis via CKAN itself, 
or via periphery components that can interoperate with CKAN’s primary value drivers.

## 1. Inbound Logistics of the Data Pipeline 

### Data Harvesting and Collection
CKAN supports data harvesting from multiple sources, automating the process of bringing data into the system. 
Also, it supports data of different nature (csv, .......)

### ETL/ELT Processes
As CKAN allows for different kinds of API and plugin, CKAN can integrate with ETL/ELT tools, 
supporting the transformation and loading of data into the platform. Government data website only allows for operation after downloading.

### Data Enrichment and Cleanup
Data Enrichment is to add contextual information to data; Cleanup is to ensure it is clean and error-free enhances its utility.
CKAN allows users to conduct tagging of metadata and validation checks before data is published.

## 2. Data Operations 

### Data Governance
**Note:** What is Data governance? In short: data is consistent and treatable and is of high quality, without loss of data privacy.  
For more details see: [Data Governance Definition](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/data-governance)

Other data management systems are just like a platform - controlled centrally, only one central manager can edit and publish data.

CKAN has a distributed authorization model called ‘Organizations’. An organization can contain numerous individuals who have different levels of authorization. 
- **Member** – can see the organization’s private datasets
- **Editor** – can edit and publish datasets
- **Admin** – can add, remove, and change roles for organization members

With the ability to set permissions and manage user roles,
CKAN can maintain compliance with data governance standards along with transparency, accountability, and compliance. 

### Data Quality Management
Continuous monitoring and management of data quality ensure that the data remains accurate and reliable.
CKAN can automate data quality checks and provide tools for auditing the data lifecycle.

### Automation and Workflow Controls
**Relevance:** Automating routine data management tasks can improve efficiency and reduce the risk of human error.
CKAN supports automation through plugins and integrations that can handle repetitive tasks.

## 3. Outbound Logistics

### Data Visualization and Storytelling
With many APIs and plugins, CKAN supports various data visualization tools and allows embedding of visualizations directly within datasets.

### Data Delivery and Subscriptions
Data subscription features and API access allow users to receive updates and integrate data into other systems. 

### Search
Rich searching experience: standard search, advanced searching (search for a certain part such as search for "abc" in title ---title:abc)
Efficient data delivery mechanisms can significantly enhance the timeliness and relevance of policy decisions.

### Data Reference and Access
Making data easily referenced and accessible is highly important as this ensures data can be checked to ensure that it is accurate and up-to-date.
CKAN provides robust search and metadata capabilities, making datasets easy to find. Also, many datasets in CKAN provide references.
