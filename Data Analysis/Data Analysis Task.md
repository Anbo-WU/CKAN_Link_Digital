## Data Analysis Task Description

## Task background: 
The dataset of rental market in ACT has been well collected and cleaned. The final dataset contains the following attributes:address, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, parking, Property_Features, number_of_schools, closest_school. The task at Data analysis is to decide the determining factors of rental price in ACT. That is to discover attributes that has a close relation with the attribute price. In this process, the tool Rattle will be used to conduct the analysis. 


## Task specification: 
1. Task1 - Data Summary Discovery: Use Rattle to discover the basic information of attributes. For Numerical attributes including pric, bedrooms, bathrooms, parking, number_of_schools, closest_school, discover information like max, min, mean, mode value. For categorical attributes, discover the distribution of values.   
2. Task2 - Correlation Analysis: Conduct Correlation Analysis among Price and other numerical attributes to discover possible correlation. 
3. Task3 - Decision Tree Model Analysis: use Rattle to build a decision tree to discover factors affecting rental price and pattern behand such effects.
4. Task4 - Random Forest Model Analysis: Conduct Random Forest Model on the dataset, in order to the importance of each factors in affecting the rental price.

## Criterion of complete
1. Task1：All the attributes have been discovered. Important findings have been reported.
2. Task2: the correlations among price and all other numerical attributes have been discovered.
3. Task3: A decision tree model has been established. The attributes used can be selective to get a better result. For instance, attributes with too many different level like Property_Features can be ignored to get a better result.
4. Task4: A deRandom Forest Model has been established. The importance of each factors on price has been reported.
